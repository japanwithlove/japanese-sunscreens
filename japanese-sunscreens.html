<h1>How to Choose Japanese Sunscreens For Your Skin Type</h1>
<p>It's possible to feel intimidated by the packaging in Japanese. In this article, I'll break it down for you.</p>
<p>It's only a handful of things that you should know and it's quite simple.</p>
<p>These are the 3 things you should be aware of <a href="https://japanwithlovestore.com/collections/sunscreens">Japanese Sunscreens</a>:</p>
<h3>1. SPF / PF</h3>
<p>Select the best SPF and PA.</p>
<p>These 2 metrics will be on Japanese sunscreen labels.</p><ul><li>SPF (10-50)</li><li>PA (+ - ++++)</li></ul>
<p>These metrics show how strong the sun protection that you can get from sunscreen.</p>
<p>It is important to be able to interpret these two metrics in order to find the best one for you.</p>
<p>SPF (Sun Protection Factor - Protect against sunburn</p><ul><li>This number represents the amount of protection you receive from UVB rays. The scale ranges from 10 to 50+.</li><li>It simply indicates how long it takes for your skin to turn red from UVB. It's likely that your skin will turn red if it is less than 10 minutes.</li><li>The higher the number, the more you can protect your skin against sunburn.</li></ul>
<p>PA (Protection grade of UVA) protects the skin from premature ageing.</p><ul><li>The number of + signs in your name indicates how protected you are from UVA rays. It is a scale from + - ++++.</li><li>It simply indicates how long it takes for your skin to turn dark from UVA. If the + is displayed, your skin will turn dark quickly.</li><li>Your skin will be less likely to turn dark and prematurely if it has more +.</li></ul>
<p>Notice: UVB (or UVA) are the two types UV rays that reach the earth's surface.</p><ul><li>UVA - penetrates deeper into the skin, and plays a larger role in premature skin aging including wrinkles (photoaging).</li><li>UVB - Responsible for sunburns and the most important role in cancer.</li></ul>
<p>The UVA rays are 500 times stronger than the UVB rays.</p>
<p>It is important to select a sunscreen that protects against both UVB (check SPF), and UVA (check +).</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines to help you choose the right strength.</p>
<p>You can go out for around an hour, whether you are walking, shopping, or commuting.</p>
<p>SPF 10-30 / PA++ - +++</p>
<p>Relaxing on the beach, in the sun (between 10 and 5 in summertime).</p>
<p>- SPF 30-50 / PA ++++</p>
<p>This is also a good reminder:</p><ul><li>The greater the number, the better, but it will also mean that the skin burden will increase.</li><li>Both types are recommended.</li><li>One for daily use, one for summertime/recreational purposes.</li></ul>
<h3>2. Texture</h3>
<p>You can choose the texture based on the occasion and skin type.</p>
<p>There are five main types of texture found in <a href="https://japanwithlovestore.com/collections/sunscreens">Japanese Sunscreens</a>. You can choose the type that suits your needs.</p>
<p>Milk</p><ul><li>It is easy to spread, smooth on the skin and non-sticky</li><li>Many are gentle and non-chemical for the skin.</li></ul>
<p>Suitable for sensitive skin and face</p>
<p>Cream</p><ul><li>Moisturising</li><li>Waterproof (resistant to water)</li></ul>
<p>Ideal for outdoor swimming and other leisure activities in the sun</p>
<p>Gel / Essence</p><ul><li>It is easy to feel light and comfortable.</li><li>It is less likely that you will get white cast</li></ul>
<p>- Ideal if you are primarily looking for lightness and ease of use</p>
<p>Mist spray</p><ul><li>It is very light and easy to use.</li><li>It can be used in areas that are hard to reach (hair, scalp, etc.).</li></ul>
<p>This product is great for hair and scalp touch-ups.</p>
<p>Powder</p><ul><li>It is very light and easy to use.</li><li>Can be used to build a foundation</li></ul>
<p>This is a great tool for quick touch-ups, shopping and walking.</p>
<h3>3. UV Reflecting or absorbing</h3>
<p>Is the sun reflecting (physical sunscreen) or absorption (chemical sunscreen) of ingredients?</p>
<p>There are two types of sunscreen: chemical or physical.</p>
<p>There are two ways to block sunlight.</p>
<p>Each has its own benefits and unique properties in protecting the skin against UV rays.</p>
<p>Physical sunscreen</p><ul><li>Minerals that are reflected off the sun and sit on top of skin.</li><li>Moisturising sunscreens are more effective than those with chemical sunscreens</li><li>It can make the skin look a bit oily.</li></ul>
<p>It doesn't absorb directly into skin, making it a better choice for sensitive skin.</p>
<p>Chemical sunscreen</p><ul><li>Ingredients that absorb and convert UV rays into heat</li><li>It is usually lightweight and does not leave a white cast.</li><li>More water/sweat-resistant</li></ul>
<p>Ideal for outdoor activities, and suitable for all skin types</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most sunscreens found in your local drugstore or pharmacy are chemical sunscreens.If you have sensitive skin, however, it is worth looking for a physical sunscreen.</p>
